##Total Churn Analysis:
  - The dataset reveals a clear distinction between churned and non-churned customers, providing foundational insights into overall customer retention.

##Churn Percentages:
  - Calculated the percentage of churned customers and observed that as the total charges increase, the percentage of churned customers decreases. Specifically:
    - For customers with total charges greater than $500, $1,500, and $2,500, the percentage of churned customers was calculated and showed a decreasing trend with higher charges.

##Contract Type Analysis:
  - Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit a higher likelihood of churning compared to those on longer-term contracts. This suggests that customers with more flexible, 
    short-term agreements are more prone to leave.

##Churn by Internet Service Type:
  - Churn rates vary significantly with different types of internet services. Customers with fiber optic internet services are more likely to churn compared to those without,
    indicating that the type of internet service could be a contributing factor to customer retention.

##Senior Citizens vs. Non-Senior Citizens:
  - Senior citizens exhibit a higher churn rate compared to non-senior citizens. Specifically:
    - The percentage of churned senior citizens was calculated and compared to non-senior citizens, demonstrating that senior customers are more likely to leave.

##Side-by-Side Comparison:
  - Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to compare churn rates across different customer segments and total charges thresholds. Results indicate:
    - A decreasing trend in churn percentage as total charges increase.
    - Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to non-senior citizens.
